# URL Routing Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis ✅ RESOLVED

The Discord bot's URL routing logic for X.com/Twitter URLs is **working correctly**. The issue was not with the routing logic but with invalid API tokens.

## What Was Working Correctly

1. ✅ **URL Detection**: X.com URLs are properly detected as Twitter/X URLs
2. ✅ **Tweet ID Extraction**: Tweet IDs are correctly extracted from URLs
3. ✅ **Apify Routing**: X.com URLs with tweet IDs are correctly routed to Apify first
4. ✅ **Fallback Logic**: When Apify fails, the bot correctly falls back to Firecrawl
5. ✅ **Logging**: Enhanced logging shows the exact execution path

## Root Cause Identified

From the bot logs (`logs/bot_2025-05-24_16-17-03.log`):

```
2025-05-24 16:18:48,455 - discord_bot.apify_handler - ERROR - Error fetching tweet from URL: User was not found or authentication token is not valid

2025-05-24 16:18:48,590 - discord_bot.firecrawl_handler - ERROR - Error scraping URL: Status code 401. Unauthorized: Invalid token
```

**Both API tokens are invalid:**
- Apify token: "User was not found or authentication token is not valid"
- Firecrawl token: "Status code 401. Unauthorized: Invalid token"

## Test Results

The URL `https://x.com/gumloop_ai/status/1926009793442885867?t=c0tWW2Jy_xF19WDr_UkvTA&s=19` was:
- ✅ Correctly detected as a Twitter/X URL
- ✅ Tweet ID `1926009793442885867` was correctly extracted
- ✅ Routed to Apify as the primary scraping service
- ❌ Failed due to invalid Apify token
- ✅ Correctly fell back to Firecrawl
- ❌ Failed due to invalid Firecrawl token

## Solution Required

The user needs to update their API tokens in the `.env` file:

1. **Get a new Apify API token** from https://apify.com
   - Go to Integrations settings in Apify Console
   - Generate a new API token
   - Update `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in `.env`

2. **Get a new Firecrawl API token** from https://firecrawl.dev
   - Access your Firecrawl dashboard
   - Generate a new API key
   - Update `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` in `.env`

## Code Changes Made

Enhanced logging in `bot.py` to better trace URL processing:
- Added detailed logging for URL detection results
- Added logging for tweet ID extraction
- Added logging for Apify token availability
- Added logging for markdown content extraction method

## Verification

The routing logic has been verified to work correctly. Once valid API tokens are provided, X.com URLs will be properly scraped using Apify, with Firecrawl as a fallback.

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The URL routing logic is working correctly. The issue was invalid API tokens, not the routing code.
