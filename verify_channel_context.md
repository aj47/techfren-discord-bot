# Verification Steps for Channel Context Fix

## Quick Verification (Code Review)

### 1. Check command_handler.py
Run:
```bash
grep -A 10 "Add channel information to context" command_handler.py
```

Should show code adding `channel_name` and `channel_id` to `message_context`.

### 2. Check llm_handler.py
Run:
```bash
grep -A 5 "Current Channel:" llm_handler.py
```

Should show:
- Context preparation adding `**Current Channel:** #{channel_name}`
- System prompts mentioning "CHANNEL AWARENESS"

### 3. Verify system prompts updated
Run:
```bash
grep -B 2 -A 3 "CHANNEL AWARENESS" llm_handler.py
```

Should show instructions in both regular and chart analysis system prompts.

## Runtime Verification (When Bot is Running)

### Test 1: Basic Channel Mention
In any channel, type:
```
@bot what's happening in this channel today?
```

Expected: Bot response should mention the channel by name using #channel-name format.

### Test 2: Check Logs
Monitor logs for the debug message:
```bash
tail -f bot.log | grep "Added channel context"
```

Expected output:
```
DEBUG - Added channel context to LLM prompt: #general
```

### Test 3: Different Channels
Try the bot in multiple channels and verify each response references the correct channel.

### Test 4: Thread Context
Create a thread and mention the bot. Check that:
- The parent channel name is used (not the thread name)
- Logs show the correct channel context

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. **command_handler.py**
   - `_get_bot_command_context()` - Added channel info extraction
   - `_get_fallback_message_context()` - Added channel info extraction

2. **llm_handler.py**
   - `_prepare_user_content_with_context()` - Added channel context to prompt
   - `_get_regular_system_prompt()` - Added CHANNEL AWARENESS section
   - `_get_chart_analysis_system_prompt()` - Added CHANNEL AWARENESS section

### Key Changes:
```python
# Context now includes:
message_context = {
    "channel_name": "general",  # NEW
    "channel_id": "123456789",  # NEW
    "thread_context": "...",
    "referenced_message": {...},
    "linked_messages": [...]
}

# Prompt now includes:
**Current Channel:** #general  # NEW
**Thread Conversation History:** ...
**Referenced Message:** ...
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
User: @bot summarize this channel
Bot: Based on the conversation, here are 42 messages with 8 users discussing...
```

### After Fix:
```
User: @bot summarize this channel
Bot: Based on the conversation in #general, here are 42 messages with 8 users discussing...
```

## Troubleshooting

### If channel names still not appearing:

1. Check logs for "Added channel context" message
2. Verify bot is running the latest code (restart if needed)
3. Check if channel has a name (DMs won't have channel names)
4. Verify message_context is being passed through correctly

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check if changes are in the code
grep "Current Channel:" llm_handler.py

# Check recent bot interactions
tail -50 bot.log | grep -E "channel_context|Current Channel"

# Verify Python files compile
python3 -m py_compile command_handler.py llm_handler.py
```
