# System Prompts: Before & After Comparison

## Key Improvements at a Glance

### What Changed:
1. **Clearer Mode Indication**: Visual separators showing which mode is active
2. **Better Formatting Guidelines**: Explicit Discord markdown instructions
3. **Table Format Clarity**: Exact spacing and format requirements
4. **Chart Rendering Focus**: Emphasis on proper format for automatic chart generation
5. **Consistent Structure**: Both prompts follow similar organization
6. **Mode-Appropriate Behavior**: Chart mode focuses on tables, regular mode avoids them

## Chart Analysis Mode

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ Said "DATA VISUALIZATION FOCUS" but didn't emphasize format importance
- ❌ Table format rules were brief: "| --- | --- |" without full context
- ❌ Didn't explicitly warn against code blocks around tables
- ❌ Generic section headers
- ❌ Limited chart type guidance
- ❌ Response structure was a simple list

### After (Improvements):
- ✅ **Clear Mode Header**: "CHART ANALYSIS SYSTEM - DATA VISUALIZATION MODE"
- ✅ **Complete Table Example**:
  ```
  | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
  ```
- ✅ **Explicit Warnings**: "NO code blocks around tables (no ```table or ```markdown)"
- ✅ **Format Requirements**: "Tables render directly into visual charts automatically"
- ✅ **Chart Type Optimization**: 
  - 📊 Bar Charts with examples
  - 🥧 Pie Charts with examples
  - 📈 Line Charts with examples
  - 📋 Methodology Tables with examples
- ✅ **Good vs Bad Examples**: 
  - ✓ GOOD: "Username | Message Count"
  - ✗ BAD: "User | Count"
- ✅ **Success Formula**: "Accurate Data + Clear Headers + Proper Format = Automatic Beautiful Charts"

## Regular Conversation Mode

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ No clear mode indicator
- ❌ Brief formatting section without details
- ❌ Vague "Only create data tables if..." guidance
- ❌ No suggestion for redirecting to chart commands
- ❌ Minimal Discord markdown instructions

### After (Improvements):
- ✅ **Clear Mode Header**: "REGULAR CONVERSATION MODE"
- ✅ **Enhanced Community Values**:
  - Be welcoming to beginners
  - Engage experts
  - Foster collaboration
  - Share resources
- ✅ **Comprehensive Formatting Guide**:
  - When to use **bold**, *italic*, `backticks`
  - Channel mentions: #general, #tech-talk
  - Code block language specification
  - Quote blocks and links
- ✅ **Clear Table Avoidance**: "⚠️ AVOID creating markdown tables unless..."
- ✅ **Redirect Template**: "For detailed analysis with visualizations, try `/chart-day` or `/chart-hr [hours]`"
- ✅ **Explicit Role Reminder**: "You're a helpful technical assistant, not a data analyst"

## Format Consistency

### Both Prompts Now Share:

1. **Visual Separators**:
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   MODE NAME HERE
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Thread Memory Awareness**: Identical section in both prompts

3. **Discord Formatting**: Consistent markdown guidelines

4. **Structured Sections**: 
   - Core Behavior/Mission
   - Thread Memory Awareness
   - Formatting Best Practices
   - Critical Guidelines
   - Remember/Success Formula

## Critical Rendering Fixes

### Chart Mode Table Format:
```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |    ← Space after | and before |
| --- | --- |                ← Exactly 3 dashes, spaces around
| Value 1 | Value 2 |        ← Same pattern for all rows
```

**Why This Matters**:
- The chart renderer parses these tables character-by-character
- Missing spaces breaks the parser
- Extra spaces breaks the parser
- Code blocks prevent parsing entirely
- Wrong number of columns breaks the chart

### Regular Mode Behavior:
- Avoids creating tables that could confuse users
- Redirects data analysis to proper chart commands
- Focuses on natural conversation and explanations
- Uses formatting appropriately (not excessively)

## Impact on User Experience

### Chart Requests (`/chart-day`, `/chart-hr`):
**Before**:
- Sometimes tables had wrong format
- Code blocks around tables prevented rendering
- Generic headers like "Item | Value"
- Inconsistent data formatting

**After**:
- Always properly formatted tables
- Never wrapped in code blocks
- Descriptive headers with units
- Consistent formatting (percentages, numbers, etc.)
- Automatic beautiful chart rendering

### Regular Conversations:
**Before**:
- Sometimes created tables unnecessarily
- Limited formatting guidance
- Less clear about community focus

**After**:
- Natural conversational responses
- Better Discord markdown usage
- Clear about being technical assistant (not analyst)
- Suggests chart commands when appropriate
- Enhanced community-focused behavior

## Testing Impact

### Test Scenarios to Verify:

1. **Chart Mode Table Rendering**:
   - Request: `/chart-day`
   - Expected: Properly formatted table, renders as chart
   - Check: No code blocks, correct spacing

2. **Chart Mode Headers**:
   - Request: "Show me user activity"
   - Expected: "Username | Message Count" not "User | Count"
   - Check: Descriptive headers with units

3. **Regular Mode Conversation**:
   - Request: "How do I use webhooks?"
   - Expected: Natural explanation, no tables
   - Check: Code blocks only for code, good markdown

4. **Regular Mode Redirect**:
   - Request: "Can you analyze the chat data?"
   - Expected: Suggestion to use `/chart-day` or `/chart-hr`
   - Check: Helpful redirect, not an actual table

5. **Thread Memory Both Modes**:
   - Context: Previous conversation in thread
   - Expected: References previous context naturally
   - Check: No reintroduction, continues conversation

## Summary of Benefits

✅ **Clearer Instructions**: Both prompts are more explicit and easier to follow
✅ **Better Rendering**: Chart tables will format correctly more consistently
✅ **Mode-Appropriate**: Each mode behaves correctly for its purpose
✅ **Consistent Experience**: Similar structure and language across both modes
✅ **User-Friendly**: Better redirects and suggestions
✅ **Community-Focused**: Enhanced alignment with techfren values
✅ **Maintainable**: Clear structure makes future updates easier
